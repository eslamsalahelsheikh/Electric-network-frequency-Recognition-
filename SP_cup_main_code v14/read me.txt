1. change your matlab directory to include this folder

2. if you want to extract ENF and features from existing data first follow steps 3:5 , if you want to work on extracted ENF skip to step 6,
 And if you want to train the classifier from already extracted features skip into step 7.

3. open SPcup.m

4. change the path in line 7 into the path that includes all training, practice, and test data. 

5. run SPcup.m ; first section labeled "ENF Extraction" takes about 18 minutes, Using FFT with 2^16 number of bits and nonoverlapping windows of 5seconds;
 you can adjust that from the functions but 2^16 is for min acceptable resolution.

6. if you want to just load the already extracted ENF you can leave the first section commented.

7. run old_trainNN.m to train classifier and predict the practice data; it gives a probability of error using some of the training data as unknowns
 and it fives class predictions for practice data.
